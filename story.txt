INTRO SCENES

Anthony "Tone" Jackson
  - Tone and crew (3 others) are making a drug pickup at a construction site, unbeknownst to them the cops are planning a sting (because one of the guys is an informant). When the sting is launched, the package is hastily handed off to Tone who is instructed to make a run for it. Now we have a chase/stealth sequence through the construction site where Tone is ultimately caught, along with two of the crew. Cue credits. The aftermath (not shown, but exposed through later storytelling) is that Tone keeps hs silence but is snitched on by his associates and receives a harsh sentence, while the other two receive nominal punishments.

Kim Adamsen
	- Kim awakens in uniform from a blackout in a haze of smoke, with fire and destruction and dead and wounded soldiers around him. One of his squadmates warns him that they had just been hit with an airstrike and there are incoming enemy squads, and that he must hurry to one of the still-functional mech suits. Kim realizes that he is paralyzed from the waist down. Movement mechanics are introduced as he crawls his way through the destruction towards a mech. Once inside, the mech powers up and Kim fights another mech and several soldiers. After apparently beating back the assault, a sudden second airstrike destroys Kim's mech and the credits roll. (introduces the combat mechanic)

Christine Park
	- Christine is visiting her father in the hospital, who has been fighting a losing battle with mesothelioma.
